### Bouncing Menu

#### Reference
[dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2427219-Header-Navigation-Day-053-dailyui)

#### Background
This dribbble comes with a working implementation using [FramerJS](https://framerjs.com/), (looked very nice).

I don't know anything about FramerJS but I figured JS wasn't necessary to recreate this animation.

I realize that this does not exactly replicate the flow of the hamburger menu into X and back again, but I feel that it hits the essence of what that animation is trying to convey.

#### Notes
Yet again I end up with a lot of magic numbers in the CSS.  The template came out fairly nice, though in hindsight, I would have used a pseudo class for the darker section of the background.
