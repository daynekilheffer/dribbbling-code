#### Background
I like the colors that the designer used for this one - which is what caught my eye

#### Notes
The main issue I've hit on this one was the use of magic numbers.  I had to resize the two containers multiple times to get the contents to all fit - not happy with that process at all.

**Random other issues**
- I did not like the glow the designer gave the "buy" button, so just skipped that.
- Had some trouble matching fonts from the design, so I picked ones that I liked that looked similar.
- I'm not sure that normalizer is normalizing well enough because my macbook and linux desktop are showing different renderings of the inputs.  (just quickly reviewing, it could also be my ordering of stylesheets or overriding of base element styles too broadly)
